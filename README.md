# Breathe

Breathing is the foundation of life and mindfulness. In our fast-paced world, taking moments to breathe consciously can help reduce stress, improve focus, and bring us back to the present moment.

This project provides a gentle visual breathing guide designed to help you establish a regular breathing practice. The calming animation and optional ambient sound create a peaceful environment for your breathing meditation.

Take a few minutes each day to breathe mindfully and notice how it affects your state of mind and body.

I hope this tool helps you cultivate a more mindful and peaceful relationship with your breath.
